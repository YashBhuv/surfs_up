# Project Overview

Analyze the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to evaluate the year-round sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop business.
We used Python, Pandas, SQLite and SQLAlchemy for this analysis.

# Resources 
- Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

# Results

- June temperatures range from 64 to 85 degF whereas December Temps range from 56 to 83 degF.
- The average temperature in June is 75 degF whereas in December it is 71 degF. Also 50% of June and December temperatures are above 75 and 71 degF respectively.
- Temperature in December are more spread out than in June since the standard deviation for December temperatures is higher.
